# ChainSongs

Platform where artists are able to sell their songs as well as the royalties of the songs to users interested in music, using blockchain contracts.

## Why this project?

The music industry has seen a big change in the last decade thanks to the massive embrace that streaming platforms have had. Although it took a while, such platforms are finally being profitable but artists have not been able to see their profits grow proportionally. The amount of intermediaries between the artist and the end-user platforms that serve as revenue streams for the industry don't allow enough transparency for the artists, and makes their earnings less liquid. In order to make the industry more transparent to artist and cut some of the intermediaries, we are enabling the artists to directly market their assets through our platform and directly receive their revenues using smart contracts, taking into account the percentage of royalties of each owner of the songs. By constructing a new marketplace to sell music, we can potentially increase the margin of profits for the artists.
